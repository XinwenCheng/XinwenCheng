## :technologist: About Me

My journey as a software developer began in 2006 after graduating from Northeastern University. I've spent nearly two decades honing my craft and expanding my skillset, and still as passionate about programming as ever. Along the way, I've worked at several companies, big and small. I also have had two startups and learned a lot about the entrepreneurial mindset and spirit as well. Currently, I'm turning myself from a full-stack developer to a problem solver. In my free time, I'm learning about indie hacking and exploring new technologies, as I'm always up for a challenge and eager to learn more...

Well, no more boasting, below are my technical details if you're interested in it.

## :sparkles: Fun Facts

- I have several hours of flying a Cirrus SR-20, and I must be a certified jet pilot someday.
- After around 1,000 movies watched, I went to [Beijing Film Academy](https://eng.bfa.edu.cn) for more expertise. And now, I've watched more than 2,160 movies.
- While the amount of books I read is increasing slower than movies', however, the number is just a number, the most important thing is to keep reading and thinking.
